# LungoJS - HTML5 Cross-Device Framework


### Lungo Framework uses actual & future features of advanced Web Development.

**HTML5 Optimized Apps:**
Lungo Framework supports open web standards, such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It brings a consistent browser environment across mobiles, TVs and desktop devices.

**Open Source Project:**
Each new line of code in Lungo is welcome, we hope that Developers and restless minds will help us to improve day by day this humble project.

**Powerful JavaScript API:**
There are many ways to develop apps, not all of them are optimized. Lungo offers you a robust API so you can have complete control of everything that happens in your App.

**Multi-Device full support**
It's known that creating apps for each platform is expensive, this situation is increased by the arrival of tablets and SmartTVs. Lungo will suit all of them creating a unique and amazing UX.



### Learn more about the project
The idea of Lungo arose earlier this year. The author [Javi Jim√©nez Villar](http://twitter.com/soyjavi) saw that hot existing Mobile Frameworks at that time were not powerful and not using the features of HTML5. If you want to know more about the project you have some interesting links:
